# Duco-Gambling-site-php
This is a template for a duinocoin gambling site in php that has a TON of games that work. You will need a host account and it doesnt save any usernames or anything, which is great.
it has mines, toers, coinflip, diceroll, century shot, lucky ten, crash, plinko, roulette, blackjack, cardwar, Color match, Lucky Letters, Card pairs, and Gem cascade. Feel right ahead to copy these templates and make your own. All you have to do is go into each individual games file and add your username and password onto it. These are not necessarly approved by duinocoin or by revox, so be careful with what you do. remember that storing password is not ok or allowed with duinocoin. for assistance message me on discord at gamecat999.
